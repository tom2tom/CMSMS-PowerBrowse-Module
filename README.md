### Overview

This is a form-data manager module for <a href="http://www.cmsmadesimple.org"><strong>CMS Made Simple</strong></a>&#8482;, descended from Samuel Goldstein's FormBrowser module.

If you want to compare it with FormBrowser ...

* easier to use
* omits crufty, mostly- if not entirely-irrelevant, stuff
* only a list-view is available for frontend display
* no frontend editing of recorded data
* a few additions e.g.
	* displayed data can be sorted on anything
	* optional per-user data-access limitation
	* all stored data are encrypted
	* more-tolerant exporting
	* adapted for high-traffic-volume data saving

### Usage

Form data is by default retrieved from forms displayed using the companion PowerForms module.

Data recorded for use by the FormBrowser module can be imported from Formbuilder.
