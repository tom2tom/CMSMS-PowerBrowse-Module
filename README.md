This is a form-data manager for <a href="http://www.cmsmadesimple.org"><strong>CMS Made Simple</strong></a>&#8482;, inspired by Samuel Goldstein's FormBrowser module.

It is NOT YET feature-complete.

If you want to compare it with FormBrowser ...
<ul>
<li>easier to use</li>
<li>omits lots of crufty, mostly- if not entirely-irrelevant, stuff (most notably - FEU browsing)</li>
<li>a few additions e.g.
<ul>
<li>displayed data can be sorted on anything</li>
<li>optional per-user data-access limitation</li>
<li>obfuscation of stored data (encryption-ready, pending a robust password-management interface)</li>
<li>more-tolerant exporting</li>
<li>adapted for high-traffic-volume data saving</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

It includes an interface for exchanging data with the companion PowerForms module (which is being developed).
